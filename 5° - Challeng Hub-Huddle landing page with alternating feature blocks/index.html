    <h1>Build The Community Your Fans Will Love</h1>
    <p>
      Huddle re-imagines the way we build communities. You have a voice, but so does your audience.
      Create connections with your users as you engage in genuine discussion.

  <h2>Grow Together</h2>

  <p>
    Generate meaningful discussions with your audience and build a strong, loyal community.
    Think of the insightful conversations you miss out on with a feedback form.
  </p>

  <h2>Flowing Conversations</h2>

  <p>
    You wouldn't paginate a conversation in real life, so why do it online? Our threads
    have just-in-time loading for a more natural flow.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Users</h2>

  <p>
    It takes no time at all to integrate Huddle with your app's authentication solution.
    This means, once signed in to your app, your users can start chatting immediately.
